# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-the-Titanic-Dataset
üìö Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and correlations among features. The analysis aims to explore survival patterns and provide business-use insights like customer segmentation, risk assessment, and profiling.

The dataset contains the following columns:

Column	Description	Data Type
PassengerId	Unique identifier for each passenger	int64
Survived	Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)	int64
Pclass	Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)	int64
Name	Passenger's full name	object
Sex	Passenger's gender	object
Age	Passenger's age in years	float64
SibSp	Number of siblings/spouses aboard	int64
Parch	Number of parents/children aboard	int64
Ticket	Ticket number	object
Fare	Fare paid for the ticket	float64
Cabin	Cabin number	object
Embarked	Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)	object
‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
Imported the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
Displayed the structure and summary of the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning
Handled Missing Values:
Imputed missing Age values using the median.
Filled missing Embarked values with the mode.
Treated missing Cabin values as 'Unknown.'
Removed Duplicates.
Converted Categorical Data:
Columns like Sex, Embarked, and Pclass were converted to categorical data types.
3. Univariate Analysis
Visualized distributions of features using:
Count plots for categorical features (Survived, Pclass, Sex, Embarked).
Histograms and KDE plots for numerical features (Age, Fare).
4. Bivariate Analysis
Explored relationships between survival and:
Gender (higher survival rate for females).
Class (passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive).
Age and Fare using scatterplots and boxplots.
5. Multivariate Analysis
Examined survival patterns by:
Gender and Class using stacked bar charts.
Correlation Matrix for numerical features.
6. Feature Engineering
Created new features:
Title: Extracted titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss) from the Name column.
FamilySize: Combined SibSp and Parch (FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1).
FareRange: Grouped Fare into ranges (low, medium, high).
7. Insights and Conclusions
Summarized key findings:
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive compared to those in 3rd class.
Young children had a higher likelihood of survival.
Larger families tended to have lower survival rates.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: Data analysis and visualization
Pandas: Data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
NumPy: Numerical computations
üìä Key Insights
Survival by Gender: Females had a survival rate of ~74%, while males had ~19%.
Survival by Class: 1st class passengers had a survival rate of ~63%, compared to ~24% in 3rd class.
Family Size: Smaller families had better survival rates.
Fare: Higher fares correlated with higher chances of survival.
